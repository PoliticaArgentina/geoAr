## Version 1.0.0

The package was archived and I did not see any notification. From what I see in the CRAN index (where it is stated that it was archived in December) I understand that this is due to a compilation error in the vignettes. 

https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/geoAr/index.html

In version 1.0.0 this should be solved, as well as the PKGNAME tag issue. 

Passing both R CMD check and win_devel:
